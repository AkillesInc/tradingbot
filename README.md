Testing out a Rust trading bot.

Right now it's does't function and I am working on getting it connected to an Exchange/Swap, and the solana blockchain. How do we do that? Not sure yet, but figuring it out as we go.

Please make pull requests and lets try to figure this out.

My vision is to get a trading bot that executes trades on it's own with some paramaters. I'd like to include the strategy cause Hurst Exponent which required the rescaled range to be calcuated. I believe crates.io has a crate for rust. (just writing my ideas down as they come).
